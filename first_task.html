        <p>Last week I got a interview call from the Premera account. They selected me aswell for their project. From last week itself they are trying to allocate me. But it's not allowing to allocate me into their project. They said i am a reserved resource for my department, it means i will get some project only within that department. But I don't know that, no one connect with me regarding that. </p>
